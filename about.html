            This site is hosted by GitHub Pages, and can only serve static sites. Because of this, some of the code might be weird. Anything that communicates serverside, like POST operations, can't be used, and so workarounds have to be implemented. 
            <br>
            <br>
            This entire site was built from the ground up by myself in order to learn how HTML, CSS, Javascript work, as well as for a hub to practice and learn on.
            <br>
            <br>
            To-do's for the site: 
            <ul class="ulArea">
              <li> Learn and implement best practices into HTML and JS</li>
              <li> Try JS frameworks</li>
              <li> Add code examples below selected algorithm in code examples
              <li> Add GitHub links on each algorithm example
            </ul>
            <br>
            All of the code for this site can be found <a href="https://github.com/Saukkott/Saukkott.github.io" target="_blank"">here</a>
