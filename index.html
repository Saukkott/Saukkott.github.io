            Thanks for visiting my site. I'll be using this as a hub for my learning, and practicing the implementation of various algorithms and data structures, as well as all sorts of other computer science topics I'd like to get experience with. Click on the "Code Demo" button to the left to see some of the things I've implemented.

            <br>
            I'm currently working:
            <br>
            <ul class="ulArea">
              <li> Implementing sorting and searching algorithms, 
              and what situation they're best implemented.</li>
              <li> Discrete Mathematics</li>
              <li> Operating Systems</li>
              <li> Software Engineering</li>
            </ul>
            <br>
            <br>
            What I plan to work on:
            <br>
            <ul class="ulArea">
              <li> Compilers</li>
              <li> Programming Languages</li>
              <li> Artificial Intelligence</li>
              <li> Information Security and Cryptography</li>
            </ul>
            <br>
            <br>
            My goal is to work in something security related, or quantum computer related. Software exploits, penetration testing, and information security are very interesting subjects for which I've been building a solid foundation to study those advanced topics on.
